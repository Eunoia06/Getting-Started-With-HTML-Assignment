In HTML, a tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that defines an element. An element, on the other hand, consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Here's an example:

Let's say you want to create a heading in HTML. You can use the <h1> tag to define the heading element. Here's how it looks:

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

In the example above, <h1> is the opening tag, "This is a Heading" is the content or text of the heading, and </h1> is the closing tag.

Tags and elements work together to structure and define different parts of an HTML document. They help browsers understand how to display the content.
